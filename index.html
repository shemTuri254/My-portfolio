        <h1>My Portfolio</h1>
        <p1>My name is Shem Muturi Njiiri</p1>
        <ul>I have engaged in a some projects including:</ul>
        <a href="https://github.com/pluralsight-projects/Android-CandyCodedApplication.git">Candy coded appilication</a>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p5>I am a student at St.Paul's University currently persuing bachealor of Computer Sceince</p5>
        <p6>As computer scientist I became intreseted with programming and basically the computer as a whole.</p6>
        <p7>This made me curious to learn various programming languages such as</p7>
        <ol>java</ol>
        <ol>C++</ol>
        <ol>SQL</ol>
        <ol>HTML and CSS</ol>
        <p8>While learning these languages I developed skills such as:</p8>
        <li>Android Appilication Developement</li>
        <li>Website Developement</li>
        <li>Database Developement</li>
        <p9>programming is a very engaging sector which requires some break here and there. When am not programming I ussually find myself reading computer articles watch the lastest computer trends and playing chess</p9>
