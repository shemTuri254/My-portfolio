        <img src="images/Shem.jpg"  class="Centre" ><br>

        <p>My name is <em>Shem Muturi Njiiri</em></p>
       
       <p> I have engaged in a some projects including:
        <ul>
            <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/pluralsight-projects/Android-CandyCodedApplication.git">Candy coded appilication</a>
       </li>
        </ul>
        This appilication was  an online store where by someone could purchase candies.
         
        The main language used by the application was java.</p>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a student at St.Paul's University currently persuing Bachealor of Computer Sceince.</p>
        <p>As computer scientist I became intreseted with programming and the computer languages.</p>
        <p>This made me curious to learn various programming languages such as:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>C++</li>
            <li>SQL</li>
            <li>HTML and CSS</li>
        </ol>
        <p>While learning these languages I developed skills such as:</p>
        <li>Android Appilication Developement</li>
        <li>Website Developement</li>
        <li>Database Developement</li>
        <p>Programming is a very engaging sector that can be exhausting at times;as the saying goes work without play made jack a dull boy. When am not programming I ussually find myself travelling, playing rugby and playing chess.</p>
